# Library-Terminal
For our mid term project, we chose to do the library terminal.
This terminal loops through a menu that allows the user to:
1. Display lists of different categories based on their status or all books
2. Search for a book based on keyword or author
3. Return a book that may be out
4. Check out a book and receive a due date.
5. Quit the program
6. Possibly more???
